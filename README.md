#### OBSERVATIONS

* Way more female candidates go through the graduate program's recruitment process: approximately 64 males go through recruitment for every 100 females.
* The exact gender ratio of candidates for years 2016 to 2019 is: Female (59) to Male (38) to Prefer not to say (3).

### Gender Bias

* The observed gender ratio in candidates that were made an offer is: Female (109) to Male (90) to Prefer Not To Say (5)
* Assuming zero gender bias this ratio should be: Female (120) to Male (78) to Prefer Not To Say (6)

***Is the difference between the actual gender ratio and the expected gender ratio evidence of bias or randomness?***
Statistical tests confirm that the disparity in the ratios is a sign of gender bias and identify the following biases per stage: 
* Screening Stage : No significant gender bias 
* Assessment Stage : Significant gender bias favoring males and discriminating against females.
* Interview Stage : Significant gender bias favoring females over males. 
* Offer Stage: Significant gender bias favoring males over females with males being 1.38 times more likely to get an offer than females.
