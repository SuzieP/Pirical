### Gender Breakdown of all Candidates

###### OBSERVATIONS  

* Way more female candidates go through the graduate program's recruitment process: approximately 64 males go through recruitment for every 100 females.

### Gender Bias

**Gender Ratios at the Offer Stage**
Actual: Female (109) to Male (90) to Prefer Not To Say (5)
Ideal:  Female (120) to Male (78) to Prefer Not To Say (6)

***Is the difference between the actual gender ratio and the expected gender ratio evidence of bias or randomness?***

Statistical tests confirm that the disparity in the ratios is a sign of gender bias and identify the following biases per stage:
* Screening Stage : No significant gender bias 
* Assessment Stage : Significant gender bias favoring males over females.
* Interview Stage : Significant gender bias favoring females over males. 
* Offer Stage: Significant gender bias favoring males over females.

***How much more likely is a male candidate to receive an offer than his female counterpart?***

###### OBSERVATIONS  

* The range of the test scores has stayed relatively constant across the years.

* No gender bias in the pre-screening verbal reasoning test.

* The test does not predict the candidate's success in the recruitment process.

### Proposed Solutions

Statistical tests show that the gender bias in the recruitment process starts at the 'Assessment' stage of hiring.  
At that stage a lot more females are getting rejected than is expected: this snowballs into the 1.38 bias favoring men over women at the offer stage.  

What does this mean? Time to change the assessment process.  

Notice how the pre-screening verbal reasoning test has no inherent gender bias but also no predictive power in filtering successful from unsuccessful candidates. 
What if the pre-screening verbal reasoning test became a more powerful player in the recruitment process?  

Using gender-neutral, predictive analytics to correlate the test scores of past and present hires to their subsequent performance evaluations we can identify the sections of the existing test that most predict on-the-job success and those who don't. 

The best part? We can test the new assessment tool with tha data we already have by 

Let's upgrade a tool we already have and use it in the assessment stage of recruitment as a powerful tool for selecting the best candidates and promoting gender fairness.
