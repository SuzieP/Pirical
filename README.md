### What is the gender breakdown of the candidates throughout the recruitment process?

###### OBSERVATIONS  

Way more female candidates go through the graduate program's recruitment process than male ones: How many?  
Approximately 64 males go through recruitment for every 100 females.

### Is there gender bias in the recruitment process? Who does it favor? Where does it start?


###### Gender Ratios at the Offer Stage  
Actual: Female [109] to Male [90] to Prefer Not To Say [5]  
Ideal:  Female [120] to Male [78] to Prefer Not To Say [6]

***Is the difference between the actual gender ratio and the expected gender ratio evidence of bias or randomness?***

Statistical tests confirm that the disparity in the ratios is a sign of gender bias and identify the following biases per stage:
1. Screening Stage : No significant gender bias 
2. Assessment Stage : Significant gender bias favoring males over females.
3. Interview Stage : Significant gender bias favoring females over males. 
4. Offer Stage: Significant gender bias favoring males over females.

***How much more likely is a male candidate to receive an offer than his female counterpart?***

### What is the predictive power of the pre-screening verbal reasoning test on future recruitment success?

###### OBSERVATIONS  

The range of the test scores has stayed relatively constant across the years.
No gender bias in the pre-screening verbal reasoning test.  
The test does not predict the candidate's success in the recruitment process.
  
### What can we do?

Statistical tests show that the gender bias in the recruitment process starts at the 'Assessment' stage of hiring.  
At that stage a lot more females are getting rejected than is expected: this snowballs into the 1.38 bias favoring men over women at the offer stage.  

What does this mean? Time to change the assessment process.  

Notice how the pre-screening verbal reasoning test has no inherent gender bias but also no predictive power in filtering successful from unsuccessful candidates. 
What if the pre-screening verbal reasoning test became a more powerful player in the recruitment process?  

Using gender-neutral, predictive analytics to correlate the test scores of past and present hires to their subsequent performance evaluations we can identify the sections of the existing test that most predict on-the-job success and those who don't. 

The best part? We can test the new assessment tool with tha data we already have by 

Let's upgrade a tool we already have and use it in the assessment stage of recruitment as a powerful tool for selecting the best candidates and promoting gender fairness.
