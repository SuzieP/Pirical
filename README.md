### What is the gender breakdown of the candidates throughout the recruitment process?

#### OBSERVATIONS  

##### More female candidates overall
approximately 64 males go through the recruitment process for every 100 females.

### Is there gender bias in the recruitment process? Who does it favor? Where does it start?


##### Gender Ratios at the Offer Stage  
* actual: Female [109] to Male [90] to Prefer Not To Say [5]  
* ideal:  Female [120] to Male [78] to Prefer Not To Say [6]

**Is the difference between the actual gender ratio and the expected gender ratio evidence of bias or randomness?**

##### Statistical tests confirm that the disparity in the ratios is a sign of gender bias and identify the following biases per stage:
* Screening Stage : No significant gender bias.
* Assessment Stage : Significant gender bias favoring males over females.
* Interview Stage : Significant gender bias favoring females over males. 
* Offer Stage: Significant gender bias favoring males over females.

**How much more likely is a male candidate to receive an offer than his female counterpart?**

### What is the predictive power of the pre-screening verbal reasoning test on future recruitment success?

#### OBSERVATIONS  

* No change in test scores across years.  
* No gender bias in the pre-screening verbal reasoning test.  
* The test does not predict the candidate's success in the recruitment process.
  
### What can we do?
The gender bias against female candidates starts at the ‘Assessment’ stage of hiring and snowballs into a staggering 38% favor of men over women.
##### Time to change the assessment process.  

##### What if the pre-screening verbal reasoning test became a more powerful player in the recruitment process?  
The pre-screening verbal reasoning test has no inherent gender bias but also no predictive power in filtering successful from unsuccessful candidates. 

##### Let's change this.  
We can correlate test performance of past and present hires to their subsequent performance evaluations and identify sections of the existing test that most predict on-the-job success. We will use this information to create a better and fairer assessment tool.

##### The best part? 
We can test the new assessment tool before even launching it with current hires to ensure that test scores are not affected by gender and that they correlate strongly to job performance.

**Let's upgrade a valuable tool we already have to select the best candidates and promote gender fairness.**
